     <p>
    The Civil War was fought between the southern states and the northern states of the U.S. This war occurred because the southern states disagreed with the plans of President Abraham Lincoln and the federal government to halt the expansion of slavery. These states seceded from the Union and became the Confederacy.

The war was fought between Confederate states and Union states, with the Union ultimately prevailing. Confederate forces surrendered after spending four years fighting the most deadly war the nation had ever experienced to that point. The practice of slavery was abolished following the Civil War.

    <p>
    In 1845, the Republic of Texas became part of the U.S. Texas had previously been part of Mexico before becoming the Republic of Texas in 1836. However, the Mexican government refused to accept the annexation of Texas and launched an attack against U.S. troops. As a result, the U.S. declared war on Mexico. The U.S. prevailed in the Mexican-American War, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.

    As a result of this war, the U.S. gained control of areas that later became the states of California, Nevada and Utah. The U.S. also gained the land that became part of several other western states, including Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

    <p>
    World War I, also known as The Great War, was one of the biggest global conflicts in history. The war began in Europe in 1914, but the U.S. didn't formally enter the war until 1917 after President Woodrow Wilson urged Congress to declare war on Germany. This was due in part to Germany's failure to abide by its agreement to stop its submarine warfare against the U.S. in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic. Germany had also been trying to convince Mexico to join them in solidarity against the United States.

    The U.S. became part of the Allied Powers, which included Britain, France, Japan, and Russia. The Allied Powers were victorious over the Central Forces, which included Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. World War I ended with the 1918 signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

    World War II started in 1939 after Germany invaded Poland on September 1. However, the U.S. didn't officially get involved until Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor. Congress did not delay, declaring war on Japan the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, December 8, 1941. Just a few days after the U.S. declaration of war on Japan, Germany declared war on the U.S.

    <p>
    The Korean War, also known as the Korean Conflict, began when the army of North Korea, a communist country, invaded South Korea. North Korea's goal was to conquer South Korea and join the two nations together as one under joint communist rule. The Soviet Union, or USSR, also played a significant role in the conflict, providing medical services, pilots and aircraft to aid the North Korean-Chinese forces. This added to the mounting tensions between the formerly allied U.S. and USSR.

             war, in the popular sense, a conflict between political groups involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude. In the usage of social science, certain qualifications are added. Sociologists usually apply the term to such conflicts only if they are initiated and conducted in accordance with socially recognized forms. They treat war as an institution recognized in custom or in law. Military writers usually confine the term to hostilities in which the contending groups are sufficiently equal in power to render the outcome uncertain for a time. Armed conflicts of powerful states with isolated and powerless peoples are usually called pacifications, military expeditions, or explorations; with small states, they are called interventions or reprisals; and with internal groups, rebellions or insurrections. Such incidents, if the resistance is sufficiently strong or protracted, may achieve a magnitude that entitles them to the name “war.”

In all ages war has been an important topic of analysis. In the latter part of the 20th century, in the aftermath of two World Wars and in the shadow of nuclear, biological, and chemical holocaust, more was written on the subject than ever before. Endeavours to understand the nature of war, to formulate some theory of its causes, conduct, and prevention, are of great importance, for theory shapes human expectations and determines human behaviour. The various schools of theorists are generally aware of the profound influence they can exercise upon life, and their writings usually include a strong normative element, for, when accepted by politicians, their ideas can assume the characteristics of self-fulfilling prophecies.The analysis of war may be divided into several categories. Philosophical, political, economic, technological, legal, sociological, and psychological approaches are frequently distinguished. These distinctions indicate the varying focuses of interest and the different analytical categories employed by the theoretician, but most of the actual theories are mixed because war is an extremely complex social phenomenon that cannot be explained by any single factor or through any single approach.

        World War II and the subsequent evolution of weapons of mass destruction made the task of understanding the nature of war even more urgent. On the one hand, war had become an intractable social phenomenon, the elimination of which seemed to be an essential precondition for the survival of mankind. On the other hand, the use of war as an instrument of policy was calculated in an unprecedented manner by the nuclear superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. War also remained a stark but rational instrumentality in certain more limited conflicts, such as those between Israel and the Arab nations. Thinking about war, consequently, became increasingly more differentiated because it had to answer questions related to very different types of conflict.Clausewitz cogently defines war as a rational instrument of foreign policy: “an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our will.” Modern definitions of war, such as “armed conflict between political units,” generally disregard the narrow, legalistic definitions characteristic of the 19th century, which limited the concept to formally declared war between states. Such a definition includes civil wars but at the same time excludes such phenomena as insurrections, banditry, or piracy. Finally, war is generally understood to embrace only armed conflicts on a fairly large scale, usually excluding conflicts in which fewer than 50,000 combatants are involved.

           <h3>
        causes of war </h3>
        <p>
        Contemporary theories of the causes of war divide roughly into two major schools. One attributes war to certain innate biological and psychological factors or drives, the other attributes it to certain social relations and institutions. Both schools include optimists and pessimists concerning the preventability of war.
